Reflection on your experience with this assignment: This assignment was extremely difficult. I spent most of my time debugging two hardest problems- one was realizing i needed to use a copy constructor and the other was because I could only use one scanner. I went to TA hours and office hours and was glad I solved the two problems, though I did not finish the assignment. If I had more time, I would definitely have worked out the last input and finish up the game! I enjoyed the concept of write data into files and saving it.
